                            The app enables patients and their caregivers to communicate directly with health care professionals so that they can receive better care and support.

                           <p>Cancer patients in many developing countries receive very few services to help them manage their disease or that enable them
                             to communicate with health care professionals which could ultimately improve their quality of life.
                             <br/>
                             Traditionally, cancer patients in developing countries need to travel a long way to visit their doctors and fill in a paper form survey to report their
                            symptoms. So that, their oncologits can have a more thorough view of conditions and track their symptoms more precisely. However, this could both doctors and
                            patients too much time, especially when some patients live in rural areas.

                           <p>Prior research suggests that information technology can play a vital role in improving health outcomes for cancer patients.
                             Our goal is to build a mobile application to help cancer patients submit their health information online without the need to visit a hospital or ll any paper
                             based forms. The system will includes include a dashboard to help doctors and health care professionals assess the health
                            needs of patients based on the data submitted by the pa-
                            tients and make informed decisions about treatment and
                            follow up visits. This will help the doctors prioritize patients
                            who need urgent attention and manage their patients e-
                            ciently. With the deployment of this application we hope
                            to study the impact of mobile applications for patient care
                            in low income communities.

                           <p> Known that we are building mobile tools for cancer patients, we paid more attention on how to make
                             our design more understandable and user-friendly. The primary purpose of the mobile application is to
                              provide a mechanism for cancer patients to submit their
                              health data on-line using a mobile application without the
                              need to visit the hospital.

                             The main design challenge was
                              to translate the standard paper based patient care forms,
                              IPOS (Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale) and APCA
                              (African Palliative Care Association) into digital user inter-
                              faces for developing countries. How to organize answer options to each question is a huge problem. After some discussion with our partners at
                             Massachusetts general hospital. We decided to put them vertically to fit in the mobile device.

                            <p>With the rise of sharing economy we often find ourselves using popular online platforms as either consumers or producers of goods and services. When we explore deeper into the theories that drive online sharing economy models we see that trust plays a major role in how one is perceived online. Signaling theory in economics predicts that people show trustworthiness by disclosing more about themselves. Research in this area has shown that trust in online profiles can be increased by providing more trust signals. According to the Warranting theory by Walther and Parks (2002), warrants (trust signals) are perceived reliable cues that observers use to gauge one's true identity. Prior research has shown that higher warrants indicate reduced online deception. Our goal is to quantify and measure trust in online profiles using warrants presented in profile information. In this project we evaluate the various “warrants” (trust signals) present in an AirBnb host profile and propose a method to measure trust based on warrants.

                            <p>In order to quantify the listings dataset, we defined several trust warrants</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Host_identity_verified</li>

                            </ul>
                            <br/>
                            <p>We then compute the trust score by summing the normalized values of the warrants. The warrant values are normalized to get a values between 0 to 1.</p>

                            <p>Where Wi is the normalized value of the ith warrant. Since we use 4 features in our calculation the trust score has a range of 0.0  to 4.0. Based on the above formula we computed trust scores for all hosts in the listings dataset. The distribution of trust scores is shown below.

                            <p>the X-axis represents the trust score which has a scale from 0 to 4, and the Y-axis represents proportion (percentage) of hosts for the the two categories. From the distribution of trust scores above we see that a majority of the super hosts have a high trust score compared to regular hosts.</p>
                            <p>Another data point we wanted to analyze was the review score assigned to a host.  The review score indicates the average score given by other users and hence is good a representation of an external warrant. We wanted to understand if super hosts had a higher review score than regular hosts.The distribution of the review score for regular hosts and super hosts is shown below</p>
                            <img src="./assets/airbnb/distribution-of-review-score.png" class="illustration medium" />
                            <p>We extracted the review scores for each host from listings dataset. In the above figure, the X-axis shows the review score which has a scale from 0 to 10, and the Y-axis shows the proportion of host for scores. We can see that most super hosts have review score over 9, and around 70% of super hosts have review score of 10.  However, the review score distribution for regular host is flat. There are some regular hosts with review scores less than 6.  We can see that super hosts have higher review score than regular hosts.
                            </p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>One of the questions that came to our mind during the analysis was - does high trust score indicate the host also has high review score? We wanted to understand if there is correlation between trust score and review score. To analyse if there is a correlation we plotted the review score against the trust scores for regular hosts and super hosts.
                              We plot the trust score against the review score for regular hosts in figure 13 and for super hosts in figure-14. The X-axis represents the review score and the Y-axis represents the trust score. As we can see from the figures below, we did not find a definite correlation between the trust score and the review score. For example, a super host can have a high trust score and a review score. Similarly a regular host could have a high review score and a low trust score.

                            <p>We also analyzed the reviews from the reviews dataset to understand if super hosts have higher positive reviews than regular hosts. We performed sentiment analysis to categorize reviews as positive or negative review. Some of the reviews were not in english language and were categorized as neutral review. The pie chart for the sentiment analysis is shown below. From the charts  given below we see that on an average super hosts have a higher percentage of positive reviews compared to regular hosts.

                            <p>Our current analysis did not factor self description in the computation of trust score. Future work could use various methods to factor in profile self description in the calculation of  trust score. In our analysis we used unweighted average to compute trust score where each warrant was assumed to have equal weightage. Future work may focus on understanding which warrants have the higher influence on perceived trustworthiness and compute the trust score based on weighted average of the warrants were more powerful warrants are given higher weights. </p>
